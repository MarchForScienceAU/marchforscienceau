                <p>Join us at the second annual March for Science! If you are passionate about science, we want to see you. If you want to see policies from the government that are based on evidence, we want you there. If you want to share your concerns about how science is often seen as a negative thing, come and speak up with us. If you simply think science is awesome and you want to share that love with others, join us to celebrate science. The Townsville March for Science will have speeches, a march, and a science fair. It's all happening on Saturday, April 14, on the Strand.</p>
